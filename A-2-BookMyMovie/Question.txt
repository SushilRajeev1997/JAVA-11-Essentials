Problem Statement:
BookMyMovie is an online website, through which the required number of tickets can be booked for a particular show. 
A maximum number of 15 tickets can be issued per booking. 
Implement the class BookMyMovie as per the class diagram given below:



Method Description: 

BookMyMovie(int movieId, int noOfTickets): 
	This constructor is used to initialize the instance variables with user provided values.

calculateDiscount(): 
	This method is used to set the discount percentage for a particular booking based on the noOfTickets issued and the movieId. 
	The condition for calculating the discount is given below: 


Note: In this above table, Value column stands for the discount percentage.

calculateTicketAmount(): 
	This method is used to calculate the ticket amount after deducting the discount amount. 
	It should call the method calculateDiscount() which sets the discount percentage. 
	Then the totalAmount should be calculated using the formula given below:
		totalAmount = baseFare * noOfTickets â€“ (baseFare * noOftickets * (discount/100))
	The baseFare for a given movieId is given below:



Once you implement the above class, 

Create a Tester class. 
Create objects of BookMyMovie class with the sample inputs given below.
Invoke the calculateTicketAmount() for each of the object and verify with the sample output provided.
Sample I/O:

Input (For BookMyMovie object 1): 
movieId = 101
noOfTickets = 5
Output (For BookMyMovie object 1): Total amount for booking: 510.0
 

Input (For BookMyMovie object 2):
movieId = 102
noOfTickets = 4
Output (For BookMyMovie object 2): Total amount for booking: 680.0
 

Input (For BookMyMovie object 3):
movieId = 103
noOfTickets = 8
Output (For BookMyMovie object3): Total amount for booking: 1020.0
 

For any invalid movieId, the output should be,
