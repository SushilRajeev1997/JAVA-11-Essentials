Problem Statement
We have the scores of last 7 cricket matches India has played. 
For the purpose of analyzing their performance, 
we need to find the average score, the number of scores below it, those equal to it, and those above it.

Consider that the scores (runs) are stored in an array of int values.

Create a class CricketScore and write a program to implement the above requirement.

Sample:

Input:

	int score = {281, 344, 265, 272, 236, 324, 287};

Output:
	The average score of the team is 287 runs
	No. of matches having score above average is 2
	No. of matches having score equal to average is 1
	No. of matches having score below average is 4
