Method Description:

change(): 
	This method removes any leading or trailing spaces from the firstName, middleName, lastName of the Student object. 
	It also checks whether the middleName is blank or not. If the middleName of the Student is empty, 
	it changes the middleName to "N.A.". Finally, it returns the Student object.

generateInitials(): 
	This method  calls the change() method of the Student class. 
	It returns a string with the first letter of firstName, middleName, lastName respectively of the object returned by the change() method.

To test the functionality make a Tester Class. 
Create an object of Student class and initialise the instance variables. 
Using this object, call the methods generateInitials() method of the Student class and display the initials of the Student.

 

Sample:

Input(for Student) :   
	First Name : “    Sushil    ” ;
        Middle Name: “ ” ;  
        Last Name: “    Rajeev” ;
