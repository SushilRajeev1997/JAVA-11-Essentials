ProblemStatement:

The Point class represents a point with x and y coordinates. Create a class Point according to the class diagram given below:

Point:

                               

Method Description:

distance(): This method returns the distance of this point from origin.

distance(Point point): This method returns the distance of this point from the specified point.


Use the formula given below to implement the methods:



Hint: Use Math.sqrt(double d) method to calculate the square root, and Math.round(double d) method to round off the values.

To do: Make a Tester class and test the following functionalities:

Create an object p1 of Point class

Set the values of x and y

display the distance of the point from origin

Create another object p2 of Point class

Set the values of x and y

Display the distance between p1 and p2

Note: You can use the Math class for calculations.

Sample:

Input(for p1):



Input(for p2):



Output:

The distance of p1 from p2 is 4.242640687119285
The distance of p1 from the origin is 3.605551275463989
