which contains the StudentDetails class according to the class diagrams given below.





The Student class contains a parametrized constructor to initialize its instance variables.
 It also contains getters and setters for its non-public attributes.

The StudentDetails class contains 2 methods i.e. calculatePercentage() and displayStudentDetails().
