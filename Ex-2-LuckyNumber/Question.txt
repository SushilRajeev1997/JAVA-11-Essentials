Problem Statement
Create a class LuckyNumber which checks if the input is a Lucky number. A lucky number is a number where the sum of squares of every even-positioned digit (starting from the second position) is a multiple of 9.

For e.g. 1623 = 6^2+3^2 = 45 is a multiple of 9 and hence is a Lucky number

Implement the above program using appropriate iterational and conditional control structures.

 

Sample:

Input: 1623
Output: The number 1623 is a Lucky number

Input: 1523
Output: Oops! Not a Lucky number
