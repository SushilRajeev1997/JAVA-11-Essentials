Problem Statement:
Quadratic equation is an equation with degree 2 in the form ax2 +bx + c = 0, where a, b, c are the coefficients. 
Write a program to solve a quadratic equation.

Your output will be decided based on the value of the discriminant (which is b2 -4*a*c),

If the discriminant value is 0, then both the roots will be equal. Print the value of the root obtained.
If the discriminant is greater than 0, then both of the roots are real and distinct. Print both the values.
If the discriminant is less than 0, then the equation will have no real roots. 
Print a message which conveys that the roots are not not real.
