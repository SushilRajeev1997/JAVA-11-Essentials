Problem Statement:
Until now you have created a Pizza class for us, which is working well. 
It has made our work a lot easier. 
Since we are a very popular pizza place, we have many customers. 
To keep the customers coming, we have kept many incentives for them. 
Each customer is called a Foodie. 
If they purchase at least 5 pizzas per month, we call them Super Foodie and 
if they purchase at least 15 pizzas per month, we call them Ultra Foodie. 
Is there a possibility to convert this to a Java program, since it will become easier for us to store all the customer details? 

Note:

Super Foodie get some special discount.
Ultra Foodie get some special discount and rewards points (1 point for every 10 bucks they spend) which they can use in future.
